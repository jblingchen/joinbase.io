## Install

JoinBase does not need to be installed. The JoinBase release is shipped in a compressed package. Just decompress it to any directory of your machine. Then, go to decompressed directory to use. 

## Prerequisites

* Operation system

Currently, JoinBase only supports Linux distributions with modern kernels, for example , [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/), [Amazon Linux 2](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-2). Feel free to ask for help if you have problems on the running operation system. ([Windows WSL2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) may be also supported for development and functional evaluation.)

* Storage

For storage, there is no hard requirement. But if you want to achieve the leading performance, one kind of SSD is recommended.

* Processor

General x86-64 version is provided for users. But early partners can request kinds of optimized versions to fully squeeze the power of specific hardwares.
